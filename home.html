Time to Completion is the time it takes to complete the desired task (in this case, order cacti) Return Rate is the number of times a user returned
                    to the page.

                <p class="subtitle3" style="max-width: 66%;"> Null hypothesis (Time to completion): there is no significant difference between page A and B for time to completion, and any observed difference being due to sampling or experimental error.

                <p class="subtitle3" style="max-width: 66%;"> Alternative Hypothesis (Time to completion): Design A will take less time to complete than Design B. This is because I believe the horizontal layout allows visitors to immediately see all cacti available to be bought, allowing them to
                    make quicker choices.

                </p>
                <p class="subtitle3" style="max-width: 66%;"> Null hypothesis (Return rate): there is no significant difference between page A and B for return rate, and any observed difference being due to sampling or experimental error.

                <p class="subtitle3" style="max-width: 66%;"> Alternate Hypothesis (return rate): Design A will have a greater return rate than Design B. This is because I believe the cart situated in the middle invites greater shopping tendencies and customers will want MORE cacti!

                <p class="subtitle3" style="max-width: 66%;"> Entering into this assignment, I know that I do not have enough data samples (n
                    < 25) for this to be statistically significant. With the amount of data I have, it will also be very hard to have a p-value of < 0.05, which is required to reject the null. Of the two tests we are running however, I think the time to completion test will
                        have higher probability of rejecting the null just because the reformatting of the page should make adding items to cart much easier. In regards to return rate, it seems like a rather arbitrary metric and would instead rely on redesigning
                        the shopping cart interface, which is something that I did not do. </p>
