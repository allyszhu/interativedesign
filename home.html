                    users' carbon emmissions. Minimum connects with users bank accounts to parse their transactions and calculate their carbon emmissions. It then allows users to buy into existing projects that will automatically offset their environmental
                    impacts. </h1>

                    <p> We believe that anyone and everyone can and should use this app, as everyone should be making an effort to reduce their carbon emmissions and negative environmental impacts. The main users of this app are most likely average people
                        that are trying to make an effort to be more sustainable and environmentally conscious. Regardless of whether or not users can afford to buy into projects to offset their emmissions, everyone can still benefit from the track and

After looking through all the ideas and discussing which components of each skecth best represented minimum's goals, we created a simple wireframe to guide

                        <li>
                            A "log" feature in the "track" page to allow for users to manually input data not in their transaction history

                    In the track section, you can see a dashboard breaking down your carbon footprint in the past week. Minimum automatically scrapes information from your bank expenditure to understand the products and services you consumed that would contribute to your
                    carbon footprint.For more granular items like mileage, time spent in the shower, and cash purchases not included in bank information, you can update your carbon foosteps with the daily check-in function in addition to logging individual
                    items. </p>

                </h1>
                <p class="subtitle3" style="max-width: 66%;"> The reduce section shows tips of the day, educational components suggested to users by the app, in addition to top news items about carbon emissions.

                    into new projects, which they can browse in a discover sub section.

                                    We needed more consistent trainsitions, CTA, and fonts

                    <p class="subtitle3"> Overall, the feedback we received was quite positive. User 1 had the hardest time of the three users navigating the app, especially with the first task of tracking which day he emitted the most carbon. He attributed this to the lack
                        of labeling on the graphs. Because of the nature of the prototype as a mockup with less detail, and hence the graphs were intentionally vague, we believed this made a lot of sense but was not worth modifying in the final iteration.
                        <br><br> User 2 and 3 had an easier time navigating the interface, and both were quick in being able to identify how to log their footprint in addition to adding a project to their portfolio. Interface-wise however, both had some
                        issues reading all text, and future design would increase the size of the labels especially on the navigation bar. <br><br> However, overwhelmingly, the first task was somewhat confusing for all users. Only the second user fully
                        answered the question of which day had the most emissions, as the first user ended up giving up on the task upon not finding the graph informative informative enough, and the third user thinking she had completed the task but only
                        entering into the submission form. This is largely because the dashboard is not as interactive as the other areas and is simply a static page filled with some graphs and text. The next iteration of designs would make them pop up
                        and clickable in some areas to make them more engaging. <br><br>Key points from the final questionnaire are summarized below:

                                <p class="subtitle3"> Make the words pop more or change from black to another color; give the app more ways to track data, such as through miles travelled or shower time length timer in the same way fitbits have additional features. This way

                    <p class="subtitle3"> Some final changes we would make based on the feedback received would include making the dashboard more engaging and self-intuitive, because this is the area most people struggled with. One person's comment about the text being not
                        visible is enough to justify making the text larger, or having an option to being able to do so. Afterall, accessibility has to include everyone! <br><br> For the purpose of the mockup, the quiz and logging information was very
                        general. The next iteration of designs would test the actual forms themselves and which pieces of information are most logged, and which need to be made easier to log perhaps through automatic entry as one user suggested.

The initial design we set out with had an intuitive flow and framework, which was something most of our users
                        and feedback agreed with. The biggest points of change throughout were with the icon designs, text styles, in addition to components style. <br><br> Some next steps for functionality would be to add in a more robust browse section
                        for users to discover projects to add to their portfolio. We would also work on intergrating the app with existing fitness hardware to help with data collection. And the dashboard would be made more interactive and engaging through
                        pop ups and buttons.
